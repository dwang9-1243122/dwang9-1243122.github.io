	<p><font face="WildWest" size="5" color="white">From breakfast on through all the day. At home among my friends I stay, But every night I go abroad. Afar into the land of Nod. All by myself I have to go, With none to tell me what to do. All alone beside the streams. And up the mountain-sides of dreams.</font><br /></p>
	<p><font face="Comic sans MS" size="5" color="white">The strangest things are there for me, Both things to eat and things to see, And many frightening sights abroad. Till morning in the land of Nod. Try as I like to find the way, I never can get back by day, Nor can remember plain and clear. The curious music that I hear. </font><br/></p>
